s3-siggenerator
===============

A Javascript-based tool for one-off S3 signature generation.  Useful for 
sharing individual(and potentially massive) files with others.  Also handy
if other secure file sharing options are not available.

To use, open up index.html in your browser and fire away.

Security Credentials can be accessed through the AWS console.  
The current location is: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials

This tool draws from the S3 Signature Tester by Chris@AWS at: http://aws.amazon.com/code/199
